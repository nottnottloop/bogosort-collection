# Bogosort Collection

[Bogosort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort) is a sorting algorithm that shuffles an array, checks to see if it's sorted, and if not just shuffles it again in a dumb way until the array is sorted. It's very inefficient

So, this is just Bogosort written in both Rust and Python to see what is faster

There we go, Rust is faster confirmed
